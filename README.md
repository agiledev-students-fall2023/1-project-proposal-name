# Project Title
What's for Dinner

# What and Why?
A simple system to keep track of what items are in the user's fridge at any given time
(as initially entered by them) and what recipes can be made with said ingredients. 

The app would ideally help keep one's fridge organized and provide a good idea of what
meals can be made, simplifying the arduous task of deciding what to have for dinner.
With support for storing recipes, it would also be a good recipe tracker (as opposed
to a giant word document or oil-stained papers)

# For Whom
Primarily students or other individuals with busier schedules that enjoy cooking. One example
would actually be myself, as well as my partner.

# How?
It would involve two similar front-ends: one displays available recipes and allows for the entry 
of new recipes; the other displays available ingredients and allows for the entry of 
new ingredients (say, after grocery shopping). Dishes can be added to a shopping cart
of sorts, with ingredients being automatcially deducted from the ingredients database
upon marked complete.

# Scope
This project combines a good mixture of front-end and back-end portions, with the back-end
possible to develop using existing technologies like databases with only a few modifications
(like queries, a few relations, etc).

Although two front-ends are technically used, they are extremely similar in implementation
and should theoretically allow for duplication with a few modifications.
